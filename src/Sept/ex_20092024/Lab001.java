   /* ✅ By using Ternary Operators max between 3 numbers.

// Input int - a,b,c - a = 10, b = 20, c = 45

// Max → a,b,c → c

✅ Ternary Operators to handle multiple conditions.

// Input → int score = 85

// String grade →

//  score >= 90 → A
//  score >= 80 → B
//  score >= 70 → C

✅ Triangle Classifier ( If)

// Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.

// Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides, determine

// if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal),

// isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or

// scalene (no sides are equal).

// Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.

// side1, side2, side3 ->

✅ FizzBuzz Test:

    Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."
